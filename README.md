SVM classifier

The Splice Dataset from UCIâ€™s machine learning data repository is provided.
The provided binary classification dataset has 60 input features, and the training and test sets contain 1,000 and 2,175
samples, respectively. The files containing features are called train data.txt and test data.txt, and the
files containing labels are called train label.txt and test label.txt.

Data preprocessing:
We compute the mean and standard deviation of each feature in the training set(across all samples). We then preprocess both the
training set and test set by subtracting this mean, and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.
